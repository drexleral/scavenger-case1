**Leonardo da Vinci**, (Italian: “Leonardo from Vinci”) (born April 15, 1452, Anchiano, near Vinci, Republic of Florence [Italy]—died May 2, 1519, Cloux [now Clos-Lucé], France), Italian painter, draftsman, sculptor, architect, and engineer whose skill and intelligence, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. His Last Supper (1495–98) and Mona Lisa (c. 1503–19) are among the most widely popular and influential paintings of the Renaissance. His notebooks reveal a spirit of scientific inquiry and a mechanical inventiveness that were centuries ahead of their time.


There is a secret is that the Mona Lisa is, in fact, a self-portrait of Da Vinci as a woman. The identity of the sitter in the Mona Lisa is one of art history’s most talked about mysteries, with the most widely accepted theory being that she is Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, something which Giorgio Vasari stated. There is another theory about the Mona Lisa’s identity which brings a completely new perspective to the work; the Mona Lisa is actually a self portrait of Leonardo Da Vinci as a woman. Supporters of this theory site the artist’s love of riddles as their main cause of suspicion. She is looking at us with that half smile and knowing look — questioning whether we will we every work out the true answer. Additionally, artists including Lillian Schwartz have used computer programs to find similarities between the Mona Lisa and his other self-portraits. At one point, there were even plans to exhume the remains of Da Vinci in order to properly investigate these claims.
